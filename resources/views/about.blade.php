    <h2>From since I could remember I have always been intrigued by the art of persuasion and have been drawn to advertising. I found myself often wondering, “what makes a brand connect to it’s audience?”</h2>
    <br>
		<h2>After finishing university with a degree in marketing and general management, I began to focus on refining what I know are essential marketing skills for any business to succeed in the modern environment. These boil down to graphic design, social media management and search engine optimization. So much about marketing has changed in the past six years than in the prior fifty years before it. In todays current climate, online presence is everything, and managing it can make the difference between a business making it big or falling by the wayside.</h2>
